# GreyskullLP
App development for the official Greyskull LP workout program.

This is my first app, and I am creating it for a programming course I am taking as the final project. But I do plan to expand on this later.

## Description
GreyskullLP is a fitness app designed to help users track their workout routines and progress. The app offers customizable exercises and allows users to monitor their improvements over time. This project has been sanctioned by Johnny Pain, the author of the official workout plan, and I am working on this with his permission.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting workouts.
- Progress tracking with graphs and charts.
- Customizable exercises based on user preferences.
- Option to track additional metrics (e.g., sets, reps, weights).

## Technologies Used
- **Front End**: JavaScript (React)
- **Back End**: Python (Flask or Django TBD)
- **Database**: SQLite (or TBD)

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanellenburg/GreyskullLP.git
   cd GreyskullLP
3. Set up the front-end:
   ```bash
   cd frontend  # If using a separate folder for front-end code
   npm install  # or yarn install
5. Set up the back-end:
   ```bash
   cd backend  # If using a separate folder for back-end code
   pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Run the application:
   - For the front end:
     ```bash
     npm start  # or yarn start
   - For the back end:
     ```bash
     python app.py  # Adjust as needed for your entry point

## Usage Instructions
- Once the app is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the relevant port) in your browser to access the app.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to input exercises and track your progress.
